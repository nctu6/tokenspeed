    The SWA mapping, the compressor state / compressed-cache mappings per
    compress ratio and the indexer-state mapping depend only on the forward's
    rows and the published metadata, not on the layer, so the first layer
    that needs one computes it and every later layer reuses it (each is a
    chain of small elementwise kernels — per layer they once baked ~7 kernels
    x 61 layers into the captured decode graph).

    This is backend scratch, deliberately outside the metadata slots:
    ``graph_ptr_guard`` snapshots every tensor a slot reaches, and a mapping
    computed under capture must not be pinned there. The backend clears the
    memo in every slot publisher, and every forward is preceded by a publish
    (extend init, decode refresh, the drafter's per-step advance, capture
    seeding), so no mapping outlives the forward it was computed for.
