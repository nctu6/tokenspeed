"""Metadata-side ``cu_extend_seq_lens_cpu`` construction for linear attention.

The tensor must equal the contents of ``query_start_loc`` (a wrong hint
silently corrupts the CuteDSL host chunk plan). Both are built together by
``init_forward_metadata`` once per extend batch — mirroring MHA's
``cu_extend_seq_lens_cpu`` — so the builder raises on absence or length
misalignment instead of silently degrading to the wrapper's boundary
re-read.
