</p>

TokenSpeed is a speed-of-light LLM inference engine designed for **agentic workloads**, with TensorRT-LLM-level performance and vLLM-level usability. Our goal is to be the most performant inference engine for production agentic workloads.

Core components:

- **Scheduler**: C++ control plane and Python execution plane. Request
  lifecycle, KV cache ownership, and overlap timing are encoded as a
  finite-state machine, with safe KV resource reuse enforced by the type system at compile time.
- **Kernels**: pluggable, layered kernel system with a portable public API and
  a centralized registry including one of the fastest **MLA**
  (Multi-head Latent Attention) implementations on Blackwell for agentic workloads.
- **Entrypoint**: SMG-integrated AsyncLLM for low-overhead CPU-side request
  handling.

## Differentiation

TokenSpeed takes a fundamentally different architectural approach from existing LLM inference engines. The **PyTorch Foundation highlighted these architectural differentiators** when [welcoming TokenSpeed](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-ecosystem-landscape-q3-update/) to the PyTorch Ecosystem Landscape:

> TokenSpeed is an open source LLM inference engine and the first to separate the control plane from the execution plane. The control plane is implemented in C++ as a finite-state machine, using the type system to enforce safe resource management, including request lifecycles and KV cache state, at compile time rather than runtime. The execution plane is implemented in Python, enabling fast iteration and lowering the cognitive load for researchers and engineers. This architecture combines strong correctness guarantees in the core scheduling system with the development velocity of a high-level execution layer.
>
> TokenSpeed also treats kernels as a first-class, modular subsystem, separating them from the core engine through a portable public API, centralized registry and selection model, and an extensible plugin mechanism for heterogeneous accelerators.

More importantly, TokenSpeed is the **Switzerland** of open-source LLM inference engines: neutral because it's backed by the non-profit [LightSeek Foundation](https://lightseek.org/) rather than a commercial company, with **serious hardware and engineering support** from vendors like NVIDIA and AMD.
